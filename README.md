    A FileObserver in Android is an interface that monitors file access and modification. It triggers an
event any time a file is accessed or changed by any process on the device.It is part of the android.os.FileObserver class.It Monitors files (using inotify) to fire an event after files are accessed or changed by any process on the device.FileObserver is an abstract class; subclasses must implement the event handler onEvent(int,java.lang.String).Every FileObserver instance can monitor multiple files or
directories. If a particular directory is monitored, events will be triggered for all files and
subdirectories inside the monitored directory.An event mask is used to specify changes or actions
to be reported. Event type constants are used to describe the possible changes in the event mask as
well as what actually happened in the event callbacks.
